# Cloud-Native Video Transcoding Platform

## Overview
This cloud-native video transcoding platform automates video processing, transcoding, and global delivery using **AWS**. The platform allows users to upload videos, transcode them into multiple resolutions, and deliver them with low latency via **CloudFront**, ensuring high availability and performance.

## Architecture
The platform leverages **AWS services** to automate the video pipeline:
- **API Gateway** triggers **AWS Lambda** to store videos in **S3** and metadata in **DynamoDB**.
- **S3 Event Notifications** initiate transcoding, where a Lambda function starts **ECS tasks on Fargate** to transcode videos using **Docker containers** and **EFS** for temporary storage.
- Transcoded videos are saved in an **S3 output bucket**, with metadata updated in **DynamoDB**.

Content is served globally through **CloudFront** with **ACM SSL** for secure access, and **Route 53** handles custom domain management.

## Features
- **Automated Transcoding Pipeline**: Supports video uploads, storage, and transcoding.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Built using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB**.
- **Container Orchestration**: **ECS Fargate** manages Docker containers for video transcoding.
- **Global Delivery**: Videos are delivered securely via **CloudFront** with low latency.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated deployments using **AWS CodePipeline** and **GitHub**.
- **Scalability & Security**: VPC, IAM, and **AWS WAF** enforce security best practices.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS Services**: S3, Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, Fargate, CloudFront, Route 53, DynamoDB, IAM, ACM, WAF
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CloudFormation for automated resource provisioning
- **CI/CD**: AWS CodePipeline, GitHub
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, SNS for alerts
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Project Setup & Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following:
- An **AWS account** with appropriate permissions for the services mentioned.
- **AWS CLI** installed and configured with credentials.
- **Docker** installed for local container development (if applicable).
- **Git** to clone the repository.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/VideoTranscodingPlatform.git
   cd VideoTranscodingPlatform
   ```

2. Deploy the infrastructure using **CloudFormation**:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name VideoTranscodingStack
   ```

3. Set up **CodePipeline** for continuous integration and delivery:
   - Update the CodePipeline configuration file (`pipeline-config.yaml`) with your GitHub repository information.

4. **Lambda Functions**:
   - Review the Lambda code in the `/lambda` directory.
   - Ensure IAM roles and permissions are set appropriately.

## How It Works
1. **Video Upload**: Users upload a video via API Gateway, which triggers Lambda to store the video in S3 and update DynamoDB with metadata.
2. **Transcoding**: S3 triggers a Lambda function, which starts ECS tasks on Fargate to transcode the video into multiple resolutions.
3. **Global Delivery**: The transcoded videos are distributed via CloudFront, and users can access them through custom URLs.

## Monitoring & Alerts
- **CloudWatch** is set up to monitor the system and resources.
- **SNS** sends alerts for failures or unusual activity.

## Future Enhancements
- **Auto-scaling** for ECS tasks based on demand.
- **Video processing optimization** using GPU instances.
